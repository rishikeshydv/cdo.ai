# ✅ Final Mental Map (Use This for Labeling)

Ask **one question** when labeling:

> “Is this UI primarily a **tool**, a **product**, or a **moment**?”

| Answer  | Bucket              |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| Tool    | Disciplined Core    |
| Product | Restricted Creative |
| Moment  | Expressive Creative |

That rule will not fail you.
